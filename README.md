Abstract:
Spatially distributed, nonuniform morphogen gradients play a crucial role in tissue organization during development across the animal kingdom. The Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathway, a well-characterized morphogen system involved in dorsal-ventral (D-V) axis patterning, is conserved in both form and function across species such as Drosophila and zebrafish. This study investigates whether a shared core mathematical model—with a fixed network topology and constrained biophysical parameters—can explain BMP gradient formation in both species using species-specific gene expression profiles alone.

Using multi-objective optimization, we simultaneously fit a single model to BMP data from Drosophila and zebrafish. This enabled us to uncover essential features of the pathway that are conserved and highlight parameters responsible for interspecies differences. Our findings show that only two parametric changes are sufficient for the model to accurately reproduce experimental BMP gradients in both species. Rather than seeking predictive generalization, this cross-species modeling framework aims to enhance the interpretability and biological relevance of computational models of conserved developmental pathways.
